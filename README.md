# wix-boost-whatsapp-alert

The "Wix Boost WhatsApp Alert" script regularly checks (every hour) for the presence of any button on the Wix Boost website. If a button is found, the script sends a custom WhatsApp message to a predefined phone number, including a link to the site. The purpose of the script is to alert the user about the presence of a new button on the Wix Boost website and notify them via WhatsApp.
